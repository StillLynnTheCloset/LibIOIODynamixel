LibIOIODynamixel
================

CURRENTLY NOT WORKING


A library for controlling a Dynamixel servo with an Android device using a IOIO board.  

Requires the IOIO libraries be added to the project properties.

Currently being developed for the AX-12A, will add support for the MX-28t in the near future.
It should be easily modifible for any of the Dynamixel TTL based servos
